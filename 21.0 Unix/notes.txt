Users interact with the shell which in turn interact with the kernel i.e the hardware of the device.

Two types of interface:
1. Graphical User Interface
2. Command Line Interface

Bash: Bourne Again shell

Why command line vs graphical?
- Faster
- More control
- Simpler once understood

ls - list of all files and folders
cd - change directory/ go inside folders
cd ~ -  goes all the way back
cd .. - takes one level back
pwd - print working directory/ tells our current location

use ALT button to edit the commands in between
CTRL + A to go to the leftmost character
CTRL + U clears the command we are writing

mkdir (folder_name) - make a new directory
touch (filename.format) - create a new file (touch text.txt)
start (filename.format) - opens the file
code (filename.format) - opens in coding app/VS code
rm (filename.format) - deletes that specific file
rm * - removes all files in the current directory
rm -r (directory name) - deletes the specified directory
